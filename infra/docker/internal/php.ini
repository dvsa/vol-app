; PHP's initialization file, generally called php.ini, is responsible for
; configuring many of the aspects of PHP's behavior.
; For more information on the config file, please see:
; https://www.php.net/manual/en/index.php
[PHP]
; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume
; https://php.net/memory-limit
memory_limit=768M

; Maximum size of POST data that PHP will accept.
; Its value may be 0 to disable the limit. It is ignored if POST data reading
; is disabled through enable_post_data_reading.
; https://php.net/post-max-size
post_max_size=180M

; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
; https://php.net/upload-max-filesize
upload_max_filesize=180M

[session]
; Handler used to serialize data. php is the standard serializer of PHP.
; https://php.net/session.serialize-handler
session.serialize_handler=igbinary

; Argument passed to save_handler.  In the case of files, this is the path
; where data files are stored. Note: Windows users have to change this
; variable in order to use PHP's session functions.
;
; The path can be defined as:
;
;     session.save_path = "N;/path"
;
; where N is an integer.  Instead of storing all the session files in
; /path, what this will do is use subdirectories N-levels deep, and
; store the session data in those directories.  This is useful if
; your OS has problems with many files in one directory, and is
; a more efficient layout for servers that handle many sessions.
;
; NOTE 1: PHP will not create this directory structure automatically.
;         You can use the script in the ext/session dir for that purpose.
; NOTE 2: See the section on garbage collection below if you choose to
;         use subdirectories for session storage
;
; The file storage module creates files using mode 600 by default.
; You can change that by using
;
;     session.save_path = "N;MODE;/path"
;
; where MODE is the octal representation of the mode. Note that this
; does not overwrite the process's umask.
; https://php.net/session.save-path
session.save_path=${ELASTICACHE_URL}

; Handler used to store/retrieve data.
; https://php.net/session.save-handler
session.save_handler=redis

[opcache]
; The maximum number of keys (and therefore scripts) in the OPcache hash table
; The Allowed value is between 200 and 100000.
opcache.max_accelerated_files=4000

; Validate timestamps of scripts on each request.
opcache.validate_timestamps=1

; Specifies the frequency at which OPcache checks for changes to PHP scripts
; in the filesystem. The value is in seconds.
opcache.revalidate_freq=60

; Enable the cli
opcache.enable_cli=1
