# RFC-005: Adoption of ADRs coexisting with RFCs in this repository

## Summary

Use the Request for Comments (RFC) and Architecture Decision Record (ADR) formats to discuss and record technical decisions for this and other products we support.

## Problem

The RFC format does not lend itself to decsions made in meetings.


## Proposal

While an RFC is useful to replace synchoronus communication, an ADR is useful to document an already made decision. An ADR won't come with as much of a communication overhead because the discussion was either recorded in an RFC and an ADR is resulting from that (not always necessary), or a meeting with all or key members of the team through discussion and debate.  These records will clearly define and record the decisions that have been made outside of an RFC or be used to affirm the outcome of an RFC. 

Not using the RFC approach for decisions should be discouraged in the spirit of transparency and RFCs are a extremely good and efficient means of team communication (due to asynchronous nature) but there is also a need to document decisions made elsewhere. There are items that will affect technical decision making that will arrive without a preceding or replacement RFC.

As documents they can both co-exist.
