# Local Setup

## Before you start

:::tip

You can use the pre-configured devcontainers in the `.devcontainer` directory to get started quickly.

:::

You will need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) `git --version`
- [Docker with Compose](https://docs.docker.com/manuals/) `docker -v`
- [Node.js ~22.16.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) `node -v`
- [PHP 8.2](https://www.php.net/) `php -v`
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) `composer -V`
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) `aws --version`

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:dvsa/vol-app.git
    ```

1. Change into the project directory

    ```bash
    cd vol-app
    ```

    :::warning

    If you are resetting the database you will need to be be authenticated with the AWS VOL `nonprod` account.

    If you have the ZSH AWS plugin installed & configured, you can run the following command to get temporary credentials:

    ```bash
    acp [profile]
    ```

    :::

## Running the app

:::tip

If you have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed, use `nvm use` to automatically switch to Node.js 22.16.0 as specified in `.nvmrc`.

:::

1. Install the NPM dependencies in the root directory

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1. Add DNS entries to your `/etc/hosts` file

    :::warning

    You only need to do this once.

    :::

    ```bash
    sudo echo "127.0.0.1 iuweb.local.olcs.dev-dvsacloud.uk ssweb.local.olcs.dev-dvsacloud.uk api.local.olcs.dev-dvsacloud.uk cdn.local.olcs.dev-dvsacloud.uk mailpit.local.olcs.dev-dvsacloud.uk" >> /etc/hosts
    ```

1. Start the application

    :::warning

    The `olcs-etl` project needs to be mounted as a volume in the `db` container. By default, the directory is set to `../olcs-etl`.

    You can customise this using the `OLCS_ETL_DIR` environment variable before running the `docker compose` command.

    ```sh
    export OLCS_ETL_DIR=/path/to/olcs-etl
    ```

    :::

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

1. Run the local setup script - this script will also as a local reset and is safe to run multiple times.

    :::info

    If this is the first time you are running the application, you will need to run all the steps.

    :::

    ```bash
    npm run refresh
    ```

    :::info AWS Configuration Sync

    The refresh script includes an AWS Secrets and Parameters sync step that automatically updates your local PHP configuration files with values from AWS.

    For detailed information about configuring this sync, see [AWS Secrets and Parameters Sync](./aws-secrets-sync.md).

    :::

:::success

All done!

- http://iuweb.local.olcs.dev-dvsacloud.uk
- http://ssweb.local.olcs.dev-dvsacloud.uk

Any email sent by the app can be viewed via: [Mailpit](http://mailpit.local.olcs.dev-dvsacloud.uk)

:::info

In the event that the local dataset changes, the above tables can be reproduced using the SQL:

```sql
SELECT u.login_id, r.description, IF(u.team_id IS NULL, "Selfserve", "Internal") as tenant FROM user u JOIN user_role ur ON u.id = ur.user_id JOIN role r ON r.id = ur.role_id;
```
